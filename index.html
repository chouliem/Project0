          The Dow Just Ended a Good Month With a Bad Day. Hereâ€™s Why.

         <p>
         A good month for the stock market ended on a sour note of jobless
         claims, an ECB meeting, and the possibility that the U.S. could
         retaliate against China for the spread of coronavirus. U.S. stocks
         had an amazing month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 11% in
         April, while the S&P 500 gained 13%, their biggest one-month gains
         since 1987.

            Too many investors are failing to grasp that the coronavirus

           Prices for stocks, bonds, commodities and other assets have become disconnected from fundamentals. They will need to fall much further if the coronavirus crisis continues for longer than expected, resulting in a deep downturn and a slow recovery. Markets largely assume that the crisis will be short-lived, a rapid economic recovery will ensue, and policy makers are in control.

           The Dow made a strong start to the week on Monday as the reopening of
           certain parts of the global economy lifted investor sentiment and
           triggered a rally in financials as U.S. bond yields surged.
